## Environment Installation

### Step 1: Install Miniconda

1. **Download Miniconda:**
   - Visit the [Miniconda Downloads Page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Choose the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

     - **macOS/Linux:** Open a terminal and run the `.sh` installer using:
       ```bash
       bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
       ```
     - Agree to the license terms and choose installation settings.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and run:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Conda.

4. **Create a New Environment (Optional):**
   To isolate dependencies for this project:
   ```bash
   conda create -n segmentation_env python=3.9
   conda activate segmentation_env
   ```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Once Miniconda is set up, install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate the `requirements.txt` file, use the following command:

```bash
pipreqs . --force
```
